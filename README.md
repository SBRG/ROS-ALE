# ROS-ALE
Generates all figures for the manuscript "Lab evolution, transcriptomics, and modeling reveal mechanisms of paraquat tolerance" by Kevin Rychel, et al.

## Additional Repositories
1. [Modulome-Workflow](https://github.com/avsastry/modulome-workflow): Aligns RNA sequencing reads to the genome and computes iModulons. input/precise1k_kr.json was generated using this repository.
2. [PyModulon](https://github.com/SBRG/pymodulon): Class and functions for analyzing iModulons. Functions for reading input/precise1k_kr.json, making iModulon-related plots, and generating iModulonDB.org pages are in this repository.
3. [OxidizeME](https://github.com/laurenceyang33/oxidizeme): This is the Metabolic and Expression (ME) model that incorporates ROS stress. It is used to generate files in input/ME/, which are used to generate parts of Figure 5.
